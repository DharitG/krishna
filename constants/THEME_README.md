# August AI Theme System

## Overview

This document explains the unified theme system created to address the issue of having multiple theme files with overlapping functionality.

### The Problem

Our codebase previously used two separate theme files:
- `Theme.js`: A comprehensive theme with flat exports (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
- `NewTheme.js`: A simpler theme with a nested object structure

This led to inconsistency in styling, with some components using one theme and others using the other theme. Additionally, some components had hardcoded style values.

### The Solution

We have created a `UnifiedTheme.js` file that:

1. Combines all styles from both theme files
2. Preserves both the flat export structure (from Theme.js) and the nested object structure (from NewTheme.js)
3. Adds component-specific hardcoded values that were previously scattered in components
4. Ensures backward compatibility so existing components will not break

## How to Use

### Importing

You can import the theme in the same way you imported from the previous theme files:

```javascript
// If you previously used Theme.js style (flat exports)
import { colors, spacing, typography } from '../constants/UnifiedTheme';

// If you previously used NewTheme.js style (nested theme object)
import { theme } from '../constants/UnifiedTheme';
// OR
import theme from '../constants/UnifiedTheme';
```

### Which Pattern to Use?

For consistency in new components, we recommend:

1. Use the flat exports pattern (like in Theme.js) for most components
2. Import only what you need (don't import the entire theme)

Example:
```javascript
import { colors, spacing, borderRadius } from '../constants/UnifiedTheme';

// Then use like:
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: colors.background.primary,
    padding: spacing.md,
    borderRadius: borderRadius.md
  }
});
```

## Component-Specific Styles

The unified theme now includes component-specific styles that were previously hardcoded:

```javascript
// Chat input styling
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  input: {
    backgroundColor: colors.chatInputBackground, // Previously hardcoded as '#0C1B3B'
    // ...
  },
  sendButton: {
    backgroundColor: colors.buttonBlue, // Previously hardcoded as '#1D4ED8'
    // ...
  }
});
```

## Shadows and GlassMorphism

For components with complex effects, use the predefined styles:

```javascript
import { glassMorphism, shadows } from '../constants/UnifiedTheme';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  card: {
    ...glassMorphism.chatBubble,
    ...shadows.card.default
  }
});
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Components

You don't need to immediately change existing components. The unified theme maintains backward compatibility.

When you need to modify a component:
1. Update the imports to use `UnifiedTheme.js` instead of `Theme.js` or `NewTheme.js`
2. Replace any hardcoded style values with theme variables

### For New Components

For new components:
1. Always use `UnifiedTheme.js`
2. Follow the flat export pattern (import only what you need)
3. Never hardcode values that should be part of the theme
4. For component-specific styles, add them to the theme first

## Extending the Theme

When you need to add new styles:

1. Add the base values to `baseColors` if it's a color
2. Add component-specific styles to the appropriate section
3. Document the new additions

By following these guidelines, we'll maintain a consistent design language across the application while making it easier to make global style changes in the future.
